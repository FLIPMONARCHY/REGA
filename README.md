# REGALIA (REGA) — The Crown Standard of FlipMonarchy 👑

🕯️ Dark Empire–Style Manifesto (Mythos-Fueled)  
REGA — The Crown Standard of FlipMonarchy  
Minted from digital flame, REGA is the sovereign token of the FlipMonarchy empire — forged for kings, queens, syndicates, and ghostwalkers who move with unshakable purpose. REGA is not a coin. It is legacy on-chain.
